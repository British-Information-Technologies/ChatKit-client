ECDH
AES-GCM Symmetric Enc and Dec
hash function = SHA-3

IV can be public but must be random to make each cipher text unique! Attach to end of cipher text and send.

Shared secret must be private and random for each communication session, established and shared via ECDH.
Shared secret must be hashed to produce shared key.

Symmetric encryption can then be used to send messages between clients with the shared key.
